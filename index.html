<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  Computing has become an integral and indispensable part of genomic
  biology. This course teaches basic skills in scientific computing,
  with a focus on applications for genomic science, aimed at making
  you more productive, your computational work more reliable, and your
  research easier to reproduce and extend, including by your future
self. The course includes introductions to
<ol><li>using Unix shell commands to efficiently find, organize, and
  stage data for analysis;
  </li><li>basic data types, control flows, functions, and 3rd party
  packages for the Python programming language commonly encountered in
  scientific computing;
  </li><li>using version control to manage with confidence the
  numerous directions research code takes from inception to
  publication; and
  </li><li>techniques for optimizing how your computational analyses
  run on a high-performance computing cluster.
  </li></ol>
  The format of the course is inspired by the acclaimed <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>-style bootcamps. Hence, this is a fully hands-on workshop, and students are expected to bring a laptop.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  <a href="setup/index.html">This page</a> has instructions on testing
  that you have the right software installed.
</p>

<div> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this workshop, for the sake of consistency across systems we
    will be standardizing on the <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/"
    target="_blank"><code>nano</code></a> editor, which is a
    basic editor that is integrated into the lesson material.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
	<code>nano</code> is installed by the Software
	Carpentry Installer.
      </p>
      <p>
	Another popular free code editor for Windows is <a
        href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.  Be aware
        that you must
	add its installation directory to your system path in order to
	launch it from the command line (or have other tools like Git
	launch it for you).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
	<code>nano</code> should be pre-installed.
      </p>
      <p>
	We also recommend
	<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
	<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
      </p>

  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
	Install Git for Windows by download and running
	<a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the installer</a>.
	This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
      <h4>Software Carpentry Installer</h4>
      <p><em>This installer requires an active internet connection.</em></p>
      <p>After installing Python and Git Bash:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Download the <a href="{{site.swc_installer}}">installer</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
          If the file opens directly in the browser
          select <strong>File&rarr;Save Page As</strong> to download it
          to your computer.
	</li>
	<li>
          Double click on the file to run it.

        installer for Windows</a>Double click on the file to run the installer.<a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/grsync-win/">Grsync for Windows</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
	The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
	need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
	(found in
	<code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
	Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
	The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>, but if your
	machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
	terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
	install anything.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
<div> <!-- End of 'shell' section. -->  

<div> <!-- Start of 'Git' section. -->
  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
	Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
	install (described above).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
	<strong>For OS X 10.8 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
	by downloading and running
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/latest/download">the installer</a>.
	After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder, 
	as Git is a command line program.
	<strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.7)</strong> use the
	most recent available installer for your
	OS <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available
	  here</a>.  Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow
	Leopard installer for 10.6-10.7.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
	If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
	install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
        <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install git</code>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> <!-- End of 'Git' section. -->

<div> <!-- Start of 'Python' section. -->
  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Download and
          install <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
          Use all of the defaults for installation
          <em>except</em> make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the
            default Python</strong>.

	(Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
	comfortable doing the installation yourself just
	download the installer and we'll help you at the boot
	camp.)
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
          Download the installer that matches your operating
          system and save it in your home folder.
	</li>
	<li>
          Open a terminal window.
	</li>
	<li>
          Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
          tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should

	</li>
	<li>
          Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts.  When
          there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down
          arrow to move down through the text. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the
          default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code>
          (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
